## Sprint 2 current implementation audit — 22 October 2026
Owner: Sonja Seferasi (SS). Existing issue retained; no duplicate SRS card created.

Held left/right inputs feed horizontalVelocity and fixed-step movement; opposing inputs cancel. Controls unit tests pass. Actual browser held-key and touch demonstration remains pending in this audit.

Implementation: [Jumpyland PR #451](https://github.com/SonjaSeferasi/ssu-starter-app-v2/pull/451), [later integrated Jumpyland merge 04af351](https://github.com/SonjaSeferasi/ssu-starter-app-v2/commit/04af351), and [review baseline eab5235](https://github.com/SonjaSeferasi/ssu-starter-app-v2/tree/eab5235b867e608693240ede1184c7ba23d1c843). Avatar collection: [merged PR #515](https://github.com/SonjaSeferasi/ssu-starter-app-v2/pull/515).

Code: [controls.ts](https://github.com/SonjaSeferasi/ssu-starter-app-v2/blob/eab5235b867e608693240ede1184c7ba23d1c843/components/jumpyland/controls.ts), [levels.ts](https://github.com/SonjaSeferasi/ssu-starter-app-v2/blob/eab5235b867e608693240ede1184c7ba23d1c843/components/jumpyland/levels.ts), [engine.ts](https://github.com/SonjaSeferasi/ssu-starter-app-v2/blob/eab5235b867e608693240ede1184c7ba23d1c843/components/jumpyland/engine.ts). Tests: __tests__/jumpyland-challenge.test.ts, jumpyland-mechanics.test.ts, jumpyland-geometry.test.ts, jumpyland-model.test.ts, jumpyland-life.test.ts and api/jumpyland.test.ts. Current integrated check: 606 tests / 54 files passed; production build passed. Unit/geometry checks are not a full signed-in playthrough.

Picture type: Blender asset/environment review render already in the repository. It is not a browser screenshot and does not prove the game matches the reference artwork. Photorealistic fidelity is not claimed.

Live acceptance: sign in, launch Jumpyland, select a world, demonstrate this card's exact behavior and capture the actual application. Full level playthroughs, hosted saving and current browser visuals are unverified. This issue remains open. Records updated today do not backdate development.

## Historical plan and exact requirement
The original planning text follows for traceability. Its Phaser implementation directions and old not-started claims are superseded by the current audit above; acceptance criteria remain unchanged.

Owner: Sonja Seferasi (SS)
Parent requirement: #379 — SRS-616.2.
Traces to: UR-616.
Status: implementation audit below; live acceptance pending.

## Task
Demonstrate and test left-only and right-only movement during a running attempt. Record the control used and a running-app screenshot or short reproducible demo. Do not mark touch controls or pause handling complete under this requirement.

## Definition of completion
- [ ] Work is committed on a feature branch and reviewed through a linked pull request.
- [ ] Reproducible checks, their results, and running-application evidence are attached to the parent issue.
- [ ] Remaining dependencies and untested behavior are explicit.

No completed implementation, deployment, review, date, sprint selection, or screenshot is claimed by creating this task.
